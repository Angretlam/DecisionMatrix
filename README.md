# DecisionMatrix

The purpose of this tool is to enable organizations to think through policy decisions, technical or otherwise, in view of the user, organizational, and security value streams. It's based on a 1-5 scale with 3 meeting expectations, 5 exceeding expectations, and 1 failing expectations. A decision or combination of decisions which result in a score of 3 on a value stream would be considered an adequate user experience in the view of the creator.

## How to use

Simply add in a decision name, and it's 6 related values. These values are:

* eSV (Enabled Security Value) represents the value of a decision for security if chosen/enabled.
* eUV (Enabled User Value) represents that value of a decision for users if chosen/enabled.
* eOV (Enabled Operational Value) represents the value of a decision for operations/business.

All values starting with a lowercase "d" represent the value for their respective groups (SV, UV, OV) if they are disabled.

Once the value is added to the table, you may enable/disable it as you'd like. All new values will default to enabled.

After the values are entered, you may export the final results to Excel.
